# Edge Device Plant Data Collection & Visualization

## Overview

This project demonstrates how an edge device was utilized to collect plant data, which was then visualized using Tableau to extract meaningful insights. The screenshots included in this repository showcase key visualizations and analysis results from the project presentation.

## Project Workflow

Data Collection: An edge device was deployed to monitor plant conditions, capturing real-time sensor data.
