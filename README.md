# Edge Device Plant Data Collection & Visualization

## Overview

This project demonstrates how an edge device was utilized to collect plant data, which was then visualized using Tableau to extract meaningful insights. The screenshots included in this repository showcase key visualizations and analysis results from the project presentation.

## Project Workflow

Data Collection: An edge device was deployed to monitor plant conditions, capturing real-time sensor data.

Data Processing: The collected data was cleaned, processed, and formatted for analysis.

Data Visualization: The processed data was imported into Tableau, where various visualizations were created to identify trends and insights.

Insights & Interpretation: The generated visualizations helped in assessing plant health, environmental conditions, and potential improvements.
